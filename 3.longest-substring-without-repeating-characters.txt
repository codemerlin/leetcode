The concept is simple 
you start with an i=0 and j=0 window
keep growing j till all characters are unique (check uniqueness using set)

if a non-unique character is found remove the character from the hashset that is at i
reduce the window size, let it grow again. 

So basically increase the window size till you have unique character and reduce it from the begining as soon as youfind a non-unique character


I have to read it again to understand it again
